Competitive Programming Training Repository:

This repository contains a curated collection of programming problem sheets and contests, aimed at enhancing problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills. These materials are prepared by Hussien Ibrahiem, an expert in competitive programming, during 2019-2022, Egypt, Assiut.

Repository Overview:

The repository is structured into different thematic sheets and contests, covering a wide range of topics, from basic data types and loops to advanced recursion and geometry problems. Each sheet is designed to progressively build a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking and coding.

Training Sheets and Contests:

Sheet/Contest	Topic	
Sheet #1		Data Types, Conditions	
Sheet #2		Loops	
Sheet #3		Arrays	
Sheet #4		Strings	
Sheet #5		Functions	
Sheet #6		Math, Geometry	
Sheet #7		Recursion	A
Sheet #8		General (Easy)	
Sheet #9		General (Medium)	
Sheet #10		General (Hard)

Contest #2		Mixed Topics	
Contest #3.1	Mixed Topics	

Purpose:

This repository serves as a comprehensive practice tool for programmers at all levels, particularly those preparing for competitive programming competitions like Codeforces, ACM ICPC, or similar contests. Each problem sheet targets specific algorithmic concepts and is structured to gradually introduce complexity, ensuring a deep understanding of each topic.

Topics Covered:

Basic Programming Constructs: Data types, conditions, loops, arrays, and strings.
Advanced Concepts: Functions, recursion, and geometry.
Problem Difficulty: Ranging from easy to hard, suitable for both beginners and advanced programmers.

How to Use:

1-Clone the Repository : "git clone <repository-url>"

2-Explore the Problem Sheets: Each sheet is organized into a separate directory. Open any of the sheets to view the problem sets and attempt the problems.
